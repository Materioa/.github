### So, What is Materio? 
- Materio is a place where you can find all the study materials organised and categorized based on semesters, subjects, categories, and topics(aka chapters).
- All you need to do is select all the four options in the dropdown menus and click "Start Reading" and it will open your selected PDF in the PopUp modal window.

### Why Tho?
- So, the objective is clear - Eliminate the time wastage finding the proper PDF you need, Especially when the exams are near and time's running out and you're out here scrolling throught n number of WhatsApp Study groups, class groups, all kinds of Google Drive links, and when after going through all these effort you still don't find what you're looking for?
- Second objective was to eliminate the need of downloading all the PDFs which at some point fills out lot of storage, So Materio allows reading all the materials online itself.
- Materio is the place for you, as all the materials here are curated from official sources and most popular sources across the university.

### I don't Find what i need here too, what to do now?
- Thats what the chat feature is for, Request the specific material you need or share if you have something new with the community. Ask doubts, Solve together, Help Each other.
- Your Requested Material will be there on the site within 24 Hours.

## I appreciate Online only approach but i still want to be able to downloaad PDFs, My internet isnt good.
- There are few easter eggs kept in the site to download the PDFs and haven't disabled it completely\
   1. For the less technical people:
     -> Open any PDF you want to read. \
     -> move you cursor into the PDF viewer window.\
     -> Press ctrl+S (MacOS users subsitute ctrl with ⌘ ).\
     Or\
     -> ctrl (⌘) + P will open Print dialog if you want to print directly.\
  2. Calling the Secret function from DevTools Console (for **Pro Users**):
     -> Open the PDF you want to read -> on the side bars besides PDF -> right click and select inspect option and DevTools should open.\
     -> navigate to console and type: download(true) and close the DevTools.\
     -> Voila! you should see the save button (This will disappear as soon as you close the pdf and have to follow these steps everytime.).
 
### For Curious Minds:
## What does Materio means ?
- Materio is just a altered verison of the term "Materials" for Study Materials, Nothing fancy here.

## Who Made Materio?
